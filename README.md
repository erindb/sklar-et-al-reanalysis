This is a reanalysis of [Sklar et al. (2012)](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/48/19614.full)

They found that there were fascilitation effects with priming, but only with subtraction problems. They think perhaps this is because subtraction is harder than addition and so sticks in memory longer.

It may be, though, that because of certain choices they made in the design, the subtraction problems happened to be a lot easier on average. I'm looking into this hypothesis here, but would welcome help, since I probably have and probably will make a lot of mistakes...
